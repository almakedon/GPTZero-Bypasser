# GPTZero-Bypasser

Takes any AI-written text that would be detected by [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) and makes it magically 'not AI written'.

## Demo

Given this text:

`A hardware ban is when a company or organization prevents a specific device or piece of equipment from being able to access certain services or programs. It is often used as a form of punishment for breaking the rules or terms of service, or for security reasons. For example, if someone was caught cheating in an online game, the game's creators might give them a hardware ban, which would prevent them from playing the game on that specific device again.`

GPTZero thinks:

`Your text is likely to be written entirely by AI.`


After using the script, GPTZero thinks:

`Your text is likely to be written entirely by a human.`
